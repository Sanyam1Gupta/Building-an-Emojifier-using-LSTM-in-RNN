# Building an Emojifier using LSTM in RNN
In this project, i will build an emojifier which takes as input a sentence and finds the most appropriate emoji to be used with this sentence.
I will use GloVe vector representation for representing the words of sentences.
I will build two models for the emojifier-
 a) a simple RNN
 b) an RNN with Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) units which basically extend an RNN's memory.
 (This mini-project is a part of Deep Learning specialization course, dataset or any pre-trained weights/models used were provided by Coursera.)
